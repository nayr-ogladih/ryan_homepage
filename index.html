          <div class="drop-i">
            <p>
              I have always been fascinated with computers & technology growing
              up as a child. My first experience was when I played a very
              popular computer game called
              <em>World of Warcraft</em>. I would download built-in
              modifications for the game (sometimes I would have upwards to 20+
              mods running at a time) to gain an edge and more user-playability.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            My first hands-on experience with coding was on a website called
            <a href="myspace.com">Myspace</a>. I would look up codes on how to
            fix the background of my profile page, customize my top friends
            section, have a dedicated song playing when a person visited my
            page, the list goes on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just to give a little background on who I am and where I come from.
            I am a first-generation Filipino American, born from asian
            immigrants coming from the Philipphines in the 1990's. I was born in
            Vista, California and raised in Oceanside. Being Filipino my parents
            had certain expectations of me - go to college and become a nurse or
            a doctor like everyone in my family.
          </p>

          <h3>Education</h3>

          <p>
            Suffice to say I did go to college to honor my parents, because they
            believed getting an education will lead to better life. I went
            against their wishes by not becoming a nurse and graduated in 2016
            with a Bachelor's in Economics from California State University of
            San Marcos.
          </p>

          <div class="graduation">
            <img
              src="img/graduation.jpg"
              alt="graduation ryan"
              height="200"
              width="800"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            I took a school break after graduation to detox and gain mental
            stability. In 2018 I decided to study for the GRE (graduate record
            examination) up until the Coronavirus pandemic started.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the year 2020 me and billion of lives were screeched to a halt
            and put in danger. I had to put my life on hold to help my family.
          </p>

          <h4>Why did I become a Software Engineer?</h4>

          <p>
            I Realized I did not want to go to school for potentially another
            five years, so I looked for alternatives.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A good friend of mine from college recommended I look into coding.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a alot of fun creating your own website or coding a program.
            </li>
            <li>It can be a tool to help with everday tasks.</li>
            <li>
              I was not the smartest person in the class, but I knew was
              hard-working, dedicated, and disciplined to my craft. I believe
              that is all I needs to become a Software Engineer.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I just know that with time and persistence my portfolio will grow...
          </p>

          <h5>Past work experiences</h5>

          <p>
            My day job is managing a restaurant called Poki-Poki, sometimes I
            provide assistance to two other locations.
          </p>

          <p>
            My night job is working on my dream of becoming a full-stack
            software engineer.
