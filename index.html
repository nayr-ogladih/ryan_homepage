        <div class="drop-i">
          <p>
            I have always been fascinated with computers & technology growing up
            as a child. My first experience was when I played a very popular
            computer game called
            <em>World of Warcraft</em>. I would download built-in modifications
            for the game (sometimes I would have upwards to 20+ mods running at
            a time) to gain an edge and more user-playability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          My first hands-on experience with any type of coding would be fixing
          my default page on then most popular website at the time called
          <a href="myspace.com">Myspace</a>. I would look up codes on how to fix
          the background of my profile page, customize my top friends section,
          have a dedicated song playing when a person visited my page, the list
          goes on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just to give a little background on who I am and where I come from. I
          am a first-generation Filipino American, born from asian immigrants
          coming from the Philipphines in the 1990's. I was born in Vista,
          California and raised in Oceanside. Being Filipino my parents had
          certain expectations of me - go to college and become a nurse or a
          doctor like everyone in my family.
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>

        <p>
          Suffice to say I did go to college to honor my parents, because they
          believed getting an education will lead to better life. I went against
          their wishes by not becoming a nurse and graduated in 2016 with a
          Bachelor's in Economics from California State University of San
          Marcos.
        </p>

          height="200"
          width="500"
        />

        <p>
          I took a school break after graduation to detox and gain mental
          stability. In 2018 I decided to study for the GRE (graduate record
          examination) up until the Coronavirus pandemic started.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the year 2020 me and billion of lives were screeched to a halt and
          put in danger. I had to put my life on hold to help my family.
        </p>

        <h4>Why did I become a Software Engineer?</h4>

        <p>
          I Realized I did not want to go to school for potentially another five
          years, so I looked for alternatives.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A good friend of mine from college recommended I look into coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a alot of fun creating your own website or code a program.
          </li>
          <li>It can be a tool to help with my everday tasks.</li>
          <li>
            I was not the smartest person in the class, but I knew was very
            hard-working, dedicated to my craft, and disciplined. That is all
            someone needs to become a Software Engineer.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I just know that with time and persistence my portfolio will grow...
        </p>

        <h5>Past work experiences</h5>

        <p>
          My day job is managing a restaurant called Poki-Poki, sometimes I
          provide assistance to two other locations.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not working, I am working on my dream of becoming a
          full-stack software engineer.
